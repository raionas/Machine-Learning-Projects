Machine Learning
Predicting the Outcome of NBA matches Based on the principles of SRP-CRISP-DM Framework: Employing supervised learning techniques to predict the category of a two-class variable either win or loss. Identified evaluation measures for a winning and losing teams.

Tools: R, WEKA

Data Analysis and Visualisation
Trend Analyses for Blockchain Technology Innovations using Data Analytics: Discover the trends and pattern on temporal data on the adoption of Blockchain Technology. A contribution for this project is a dataset composed of Blockchain related tweets that were scraped from Twitter and applied data visualisation techniques such as ggplot, time-series, and geolocation methods.

Tools: R, Tableau

Micro Projects
Second-hand Car Price Prediction: Employing supervised learning techniques for a regression problem in predicting the car value against the actual value of a second-hand vehicle. Investigating which input variables like model, make, mileage, cruise control, cylinders, etc. will drive the price of the car.

Tool: R
